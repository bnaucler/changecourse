            Some say that dreaming is dead and that the days of great explorers have

            dreaming has never been more important.
            <br><br>
            There are problems in front of us, some so overwhelming that many choose to
            ignore them. But for those who dare to dream of solutions, no mountain is too
            high to climb.

            As a participant in change course you will not only take part in the education,

            <b>change course</b> is comprised of two stand-alone years of full-time studies:
            <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrl('toolbox')">The Changemaker's Toolbox</a> &amp;
            <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrl('impact')">Making Impact.</a> This
            means that you can follow the full two-year program or either of
            the two years independently, whatever suits your wants and needs.
            <br><br>
            You will undertake the eduation together with a group of highly motivated
            changemakers from all over the EU. The working language is English, though all
            school staff members are also proficient in Swedish.

        <p>
            During the first year of <b>change course</b> our main focus is on building your
            toolbox - to experiment with tools and methods for changemaking out in the real
            world. To do this we construct our own non-profit organization, complete with
            leadership, teams, processes and functions for continuous improvement.

            The second year of the education has a slightly different format. The majority

            you the means to completely immerse yourself in an issue and a solution of your

        <p>
            There are many ways in which changemakers can make their impact. We can start a
            new business or non-profit. We can help transforming existing businesses to
            become more aware of how their behavior affect the world, and make that
            footprint a positive one. We can apply our methods and tools to serve the
            causes that are dear to us, whichever those causes might be.
            <br><br>
            One thing we're fairly certain of is that when the course is over, you'll leave
            with sharp problem solving skills and be on a mission to change things for the
            better. This together with like-minded individuals, some of which who will be your
            friends for life.

        <h3 class="tb">THE FOLK HIGH SCHOOL SYSTEM</h3>
        <p>
            The folk high school (<i>"folkhögskola"</i>) is a nordic form of adult education. It is a place where
            people meet to study, connect and gain new insights. At the folk high school
            participants can complete unfinished high school studies, focus on deepening
            their interests or educate themselves for an occupation.
            <br><br>
            Studies in traditional school subjects go hand in hand with a more free form of
            knowledge acquisition.  The living conversation, collaboration, personal
            development and participant influence are all central to the folk high school
            concept. More information can be found <a href="https://www.folkhogskola.nu/globalassets/dokument-och-filer/folkhogskola_eng_engelska.pdf">here</a> (pdf).

            spirit of innovation and flexibility.

            The education is classified as post-gymnasial (<i>"eftergymnasial"</i>). This means

            You do not need to have a solid idea of what it is you would like to focus your
            energy on during the education period, this is something we can explore
            together. What you <b>DO</b> need is the motivation and energy to make a positive
            difference.
            <br><br>
            All lectures and workshops are conducted in English, meaning that
