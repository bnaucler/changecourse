            <br><br>
            There are problems in front of us, some so overwhelming that many choose to

            There are many ways in which changemakers can make their impact. We can start a
            new business or non-profit. We can help transforming existing businesses to
            become more aware of how their behavior affect the world, and make that
            footprint a positive one. We can apply our methods and tools to serve the
            causes that are dear to us, whichever those causes might be.
            <br><br>
            One thing we're fairly certain of is that when the course is over, you'll leave
            with sharp problem solving skills and be on a mission to change things for the
            better. This together with like-minded individuals, some of which who will be your
            friends for life.

        <p>
            The folk high school (<i>"folkhögskola"</i>) is a nordic form of adult education. It is a place where
            people meet to study, connect and gain new insights. At the folk high school
            participants can complete unfinished high school studies, focus on deepening
            their interests or educate themselves for an occupation.
            <br><br>
            Studies in traditional school subjects go hand in hand with a more free form of
            knowledge acquisition.  The living conversation, collaboration, personal
            development and participant influence are all central to the folk high school concept.
            <br><br>

            The education is classified as gymnasial adult education. This

            of age, and who have completed an education at the elementary

            what a university would deliver.
            <br><br>
            You do not need to have a solid idea of what it is you would like to focus your
            energy on during the education period, this is something we can explore
            together. What you <b>DO</b> need is the motivation and energy to make a positive
            difference.
            <br><br>
            All lectures and workshops are conducted in English, meaning that
